# Design-of-an-Earth-Coupled-Air-Conditioning-Unit
##### An Earth-Couple Air Conditioning (ECAC) unit was designed and analyzed in order to cooled a house during the summer. A double pipe heat exchanger was designed in which the refrigerant flows in the inner tube and water flows in annulus. The water would absorb energy from the refrigerant and then is pumped underground, and by heat transfer to the soil, the water loses the energy it gained from the refrigerant.The ECAC unit may use a U-bend or spiral coil pipe line that is buried underground and to run a hydronic heat exchanger fluid, likewise it can be seen in the below design the condenser will be replaced by a double pipe heat exchanger. The following constraints/assumptions were outlined for this project.
  * Heat exchanger is insulated from its surroundings
  * Constant specific heats
  * Ground temperatures are constant at 47 ÂºF at soil depth greater than 30 feet for Boston Massachusetts
  * Negligible heat loss to surroundings
  * Incompressible fluids
  * Ideal Vapor-Compression Refrigeration cycle
